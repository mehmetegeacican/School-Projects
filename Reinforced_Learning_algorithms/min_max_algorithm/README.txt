THE MIN  MAX ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

1) Generate Tree of all possible moves
2) Each position or node of the tree holds a Heuristic value
3) Algorithm then starts from the leaf of the tree, the left-most, deciding the best move for that player and removing all bad ones

THE MIN MAX ALGORITHM HAS BEEN USED FOR STICKS GAME
HOW TO:
    From 11 sticks,
    You either choose 1 or 2 sticks and then computer chooses 1 or 2 sticks
    The last one to pick the last stick wins

HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
    Step-1)Find the file directory in your cmd(... --> cd MIN_MAX_PROBLEM)
    Step-2)Run the code via command(python min_max.py)
    Step.2) If you are using linux, you can use the 'make' command. Python automatically compiles and runs with 'make' command on linux
